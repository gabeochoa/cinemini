HackBU Spring 2015

This project is an attempt to appeal to the movie watcher where time is a major factor in whether or not a movie can be watched.

This program takes a subtitle file and full length film and creates a condensed version that can be watched to gain the full knowledge of the plot. This is obtained by using Wikipedia's api to collect information about the basic plot structure of the film and comparing it to grammatical structures in the subtitles. We then create small clips based on what subtitles we deem useful and then generate a final video from the clip files.
